# groundhog-tidytuesday
Shiny app with visualizations relating to groundhogs code
Started 08/17/2024 by MM - employing visualization techniques from 2024 SISBID (UW Seattle)

Goals:
(1) Deploy Shiny app that shows regions with groundhogs that have the highest rate of spotting their shadows over time and geographically across North America
(2) Determine whether pure groundhogs vs. all other predictors have greater rates of spotting their shadows
